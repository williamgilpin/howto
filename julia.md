### Installing Julia

+ Download the correct installer from the Julia website. Install like a normal program.

+ Add Julia to the Python path in the Terminal. For example,

    export PATH="$PATH:/Applications/Julia-1.11.app/Contents/Resources/julia/bin"

+ Test that Julia is installed correctly by running the following command in the Terminal:

    julia

+ You should see the Julia REPL. Exit by typing `exit()`.

+ Add Julia to your path permanently by adding the following line to your `.bash_profile`, `.zshrc`, or `.bashrc` file:

    export PATH="$PATH:/Applications/Julia-1.11.app/Contents/Resources/julia/bin"
